Solidum Jr. said that the country should level up its disaster preparations to
include complex, multi-hazard disasters scenarios in its plans and
preparations. <b><i>(Photo courtesy of journal.com.ph)</i></b> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“Does survival imply
resilience?” This was posted by Department of Science and Technology (DOST)
secretary Renato U. Solidum Jr. during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Handa
Pilipinas: Innovations in Disaster Resilience Luzon Leg held on 3 July 2024 at
the Plaza Del Norte Hotel and Convention Center, Laoag City, Ilocos Norte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Solidum emphasizes that
Filipinos have always been portrayed as resilient during disasters as
characterized by having pleasant disposition in the face of hazards but that
does that really mean resiliency?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">The Philippines is prone to
various hazards as Region I alone, is prone to the passage of tropical cyclones
and floods. Solidum explained that the region is also exposed to strong
earthquakes. He cited that the hills near the shoreline on the Municipality of
Currimao show ladderlike hill embankments suggesting that major earthquakes had
occurred some three to four times in the past years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“We want to express our
aspiration to become a community, a region, a country that is ready and
prepared against hazards,” declared Solidum. He added that through this
exposition, the public awareness towards knowledge in natural hazards and the
latest technologies is heightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Solidum also shared that the key
to building climate and disaster resilience is to redefine the Filipino context
of resilience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">In most cases, he said,
Filipinos are portrayed smiling after any disaster. “<i>Mahilig magpapicture
ang mga Filipino kahit mayroong baha pero nakangiti pa rin</i>.” He said that
this is associated with accepting the worst conditions. However, these norms
are a deterrent to achieving resiliency as this leads to lowering the standards
for the quality of life that we are supposed to have. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Additionally, he said that the
frequent exposure to hazards in the Philippines suggests that we should
transform the Filipino mindset and culture of resilience. Resilience should
allow the Filipinos to adopt, resist, transform, and recover from the effects
of the hazard in a timely and efficient manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“Resilience is moving beyond
merely surviving the impacts of disasters,” stressed Solidum. “But instead
making resilience a way of life, embedded in our households, schools,
communities, businesses, economy, and governance.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">He also shared the three
important goals that should guide the government in achieving resiliency which
are to reduce the various risks prior to hazard occurrence which is to
strengthen the houses that we build, locate to a safer area, and make sure that
structures are usable before and after the hazards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">He stressed the need to ensure
evidence-based local land-use plans, local development plans, investing in
infrastructure resilience and ensuring resilient businesses and economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Efficient response to hazards
is equally important. He explained that we need to prepare so we can respond
faster and effectively. He emphasized the need for preparedness to respond to
lessen the loss of life by making sure that the recovery and medical aspects
during emergency responses are efficiently carried out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Lastly, we need to improve
managing complex worst-case scenarios while ensuring interoperability among key
stakeholders. “Our earthquake drills are done without the assumption that a
typhoon or rain will occur during the earthquake event or before or after,”
Solidum pointed out. He added that this scenario had happened during the Mt.
Pinatubo eruption in 1991. He said that all these compounding hazards must be
part of the simulation scenario to prepare for big events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“<i>Handa na po ang Pilipinas
sa maliliit na trahedya. Local government kayang-kaya,” he said. </i>“But we
are not prepared for large-scale events. We are there preparing but we still
need to do more, that is why we have (Handa Pilipinas) campaign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Handa Pilipinas: Innovations
in Disaster Resilience is a disaster risk reduction and resiliency campaign
initiative to help spread public awareness and knowledge towards disaster
preparedness to help the local government get access to the latest technologies
developed by DOST and its partner organizations. Aside from various forums on
disaster mitigation, the expo also presents several locally developed and
market-ready technologies for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

public and runs from July 3-5, 2024. (30)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
