                    earthquakes in 2019, and heavy rainfall-related incidents in 2022.

                <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sec.
                    Solidum explained that primarily, we have to recognize that disasters
                    are undoing the strides in development. Few things erode progress as
                    swiftly and comprehensively as disasters do, capable of obliterating
                    years of advancement in an instant. He added that consequently, as we
                    strive to bolster our economy in Mindanao, safeguarding our resources
                    and wealth necessitates a concerted effort to mitigate climate and
                    disaster risks.</font>

                <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">He
                    also emphasized that the Philippines continues to hold the
                    distinction of being the most vulnerable nation in terms of natural
                    hazards and climate change. Recently, on September 20, 2023, the
                    World Risk Report 2023 affirmed our vulnerability, ranking us first
                    among 193 countries for the second consecutive year. Climate change
                    is exacerbating the intensity and unpredictability of existing hazard
                    events, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable communities.</font>

                    we also see an opportunity to change this narrative. We need to take
                    a firm stand and commitment to reduce our vulnerabilities and make
                    our own redefined and reimagined Filipino brand of resilience. And we
                    cannot do that alone. We need the whole-of-society to make our vision
                    of safer, adaptive, climate and disaster-resilient Filipino
                    communities towards sustainable development a reality,&quot; said

                    Secretary Solidum emphasized that the Philippines, renowned as an
                    archipelago of risks, has seen its fair share of disasters in
                    Mindanao. Notably, Tropical Storm Sendong in 2011 claimed over 1000
                    lives and impacted nearly 700,000 people. From 2015 to 2016, El Niño
                    wreaked havoc, leading to states of calamity in areas like
                    Maguindanao and Cotabato City. Mindanao was also struck by a series
                    of earthquakes in 2019, causing significant damage. Most recently in
                    2022, heavy rainfall led to fatal incidents in Maguindanao del Norte,
                    underscoring the region's vulnerability.</font>

            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Solidum emphasizes that
            Filipinos have always been portrayed as resilient during disasters as
            characterized by having pleasant disposition in the face of hazards but that
            does that really mean resiliency?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">The Philippines is prone to
            various hazards as Region I alone, is prone to the passage of tropical cyclones
            and floods. Solidum explained that the region is also exposed to strong
            earthquakes. He cited that the hills near the shoreline on the Municipality of
            Currimao show ladderlike hill embankments suggesting that major earthquakes had
            occurred some three to four times in the past years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            aspiration to become a community, a region, a country that is ready and
            prepared against hazards,” declared Solidum. He added that through this
            exposition, the public awareness towards knowledge in natural hazards and the
            latest technologies is heightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Solidum also shared that the key
            to building climate and disaster resilience is to redefine the Filipino context
            of resilience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">In most cases, he said,
            Filipinos are portrayed smiling after any disaster. “<i>Mahilig magpapicture
            ang mga Filipino kahit mayroong baha pero nakangiti pa rin</i>.” He said that
            this is associated with accepting the worst conditions. However, these norms
            are a deterrent to achieving resiliency as this leads to lowering the standards
            for the quality of life that we are supposed to have. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Additionally, he said that the
            frequent exposure to hazards in the Philippines suggests that we should
            transform the Filipino mindset and culture of resilience. Resilience should
            allow the Filipinos to adopt, resist, transform, and recover from the effects
            of the hazard in a timely and efficient manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">“Resilience is moving beyond
            merely surviving the impacts of disasters,” stressed Solidum. “But instead
            making resilience a way of life, embedded in our households, schools,
            communities, businesses, economy, and governance.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">He also shared the three
            important goals that should guide the government in achieving resiliency which
            are to reduce the various risks prior to hazard occurrence which is to
            strengthen the houses that we build, locate to a safer area, and make sure that
            structures are usable before and after the hazards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">He stressed the need to ensure
            evidence-based local land-use plans, local development plans, investing in
            infrastructure resilience and ensuring resilient businesses and economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal mb-6" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Efficient response to hazards
            is equally important. He explained that we need to prepare so we can respond
            faster and effectively. He emphasized the need for preparedness to respond to
            lessen the loss of life by making sure that the recovery and medical aspects
            during emergency responses are efficiently carried out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Lastly, we need to improve
            managing complex worst-case scenarios while ensuring interoperability among key
            stakeholders. “Our earthquake drills are done without the assumption that a
            typhoon or rain will occur during the earthquake event or before or after,”
            Solidum pointed out. He added that this scenario had happened during the Mt.
            Pinatubo eruption in 1991. He said that all these compounding hazards must be
            part of the simulation scenario to prepare for big events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <p class="mb-5">Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Renato U. Solidum Jr. emphasized that, beyond technological advancements, empowering citizens to prepare them for disasters is essential.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Solidum made this statement during the opening of the 2025 HANDA Pilipinas sa Bagong Pilipinas event, which took place from August 7 to 9, 2025, at the Newtown Convention Center in Baguio City, located in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).</p>
            <p class="mb-5">&ldquo;This means that when communities understand the risks and have the tools and knowledge to act, they become stronger and safer,&rdquo; he added.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Handa Pilipinas sa Bagong Pilipinas showcases local technologies that can be adopted by Local Government Units to help communities prepare and respond to various natural hazards including earthquakes, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires among others.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Meanwhile, Baguio City Vice Mayor Faustino Olowan recognizes the need for efforts to be grounded on science-based knowledge to prepare for disaster. He stated that science is crucial for surviving the risks associated with natural hazards. &ldquo;In this era of increasing climate threats, environmental uncertainties, and fast-evolving challenges, science and innovation are no longer optional,&rdquo; Olowan emphasized. &ldquo;They are imperatives for survival and sustainability.&rdquo;</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Olowan added that they need to embrace the concept of a smart, sustainable, and disaster-resilient community as the city is exposed to extreme weather conditions. Just last month, heavy rains caused landslides and flooding in Baguio and nearby areas in Benguet.</p>
            <p class="mb-5"><strong>Science-based, local solutions</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-5">One of the technologies highlighted is the <strong>GeoRiskPH</strong> &mdash; an online platform that maps out hazards such as active fault lines, flood zones, and landslide-prone areas. &ldquo;GeoRiskPH is more than just a data collection and repository; it&rsquo;s a governance platform that fosters collaboration across sectors and provides clear guidance for decision-makers in a transparent, systematic, and efficient manner,&rdquo; Solidum explained.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Just recently, the Cordillera Regional Land Use Committee (RLUC) adopted GeoRiskPH to be used in advanced hazard mapping and risk analysis to support safer spatial planning and infrastructure development. The adoption demonstrated the scalability of the platform to conform with the regional development needs.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">HANDA Pilipinas also highlighted grassroot efforts and community-based innovations, including Dynaslope, which uses sensors to detect early signs of landslides; Project SARAI or Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines, which provides climate-smart agriculture advisories to farmers; and Project DANAS, a knowledge-based communication toolkit to be used by instructors and disaster risk reduction and management practitioners in various local languages</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Additionally, DOST distributed vital knowledge resources such as the <em>HANDA Pilipinas</em> Local Caravan Guidebook, exhibit modules, and the Seismic Hazard Atlas (developed through the SHADE Project: Seismic Hazard Assessment for the Design Earthquake of the Philippines) to provincial LGUs in CAR and Baguio City. These materials are intended to strengthen local awareness campaigns and community education initiatives.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">The event also marked the official launch of the Cordillera DREAM (Disaster Risk Evaluation, Analytics, and Management) Project, a groundbreaking initiative that aims to utilize big data and artificial intelligence to transform risk analytics and disaster management in the Cordillera region.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Meanwhile, the 2025 Regional Science, Technology and Innovation Week (RSTW) celebration has officially kicked off right after. The RSTW in CAR 2025 showcases local scientific achievements, innovations, and solutions on food, textiles, health, among others, from various DOST Research and Development Institutes and academic partners. Visitors can experience firsthand several interactive Science and Technology exhibits and forums including the DOST-Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, Astronomical Services Administration Mobile Planetarium, the Disaster Risk Reduction themed Escape Room, and the NuLab: STEM in Motion, a mobile laboratory for students.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Other key events include the launching of the Advanced Manufacturing Center in CAR, DOST-Benguet Innovation Hub, and the turnover of the Mountain Engineering Technologies to LGUs.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">HANDA Pilipinas sa Bagong Pilipinas and the 2025 RSTW are among the many initiatives of the Department of Science and Technology aimed at providing science-based, innovative, and inclusive solutions across four strategic pillars: human well-being, wealth creation, wealth protection, and sustainability. These pillars embody the mantra OneDOST4U: Solutions, Opportunities for All. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.dost.gov.ph">www.dost.gov.ph</a>. <strong><em>(By Abigael S.

    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is renowned for its breathtaking landscapes&mdash;dramatic mountain ranges, steep slopes, towering peaks, and winding valleys shaped by its rugged terrain. However, this striking topography also brings significant challenges. The region's loose soil, combined with heavy rainfall and frequent seismic activity, makes the region vulnerable to landslides.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">These natural hazards pose risks not only to infrastructure and livelihoods but also to the safety and resilience of the communities that call the highlands home.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">Once overwhelmed by disasters, LGUs across the Philippines are now emerging as champions of innovation, thanks to science-backed tools, capacity building, and community-driven technologies that are transforming preparedness into resilience.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">&ldquo;<em>Nandyan din yung banta ng bagyo at ulan, at nakita din natin yung kahalagahan ng gabay sa ating mga kababayan. Una, sa impormasyon na p&rsquo;wede kong ibigay sa kanila. Yung science-based information. Pangalawa, yung teknolohiya para mabigyan sila sa posibleng solusyon sa hinaharap nilang problema, at s&rsquo;yempre, yung training o kasanayan na kailangan ibigay natin</em>,&rdquo; said DOST Secretary Renato U. Solidum Jr during the 2025 HANDA Pilipinas press conference in Baguio City.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">(There&rsquo;s also the threat of storms and rain, and we&rsquo;ve seen the importance of guidance for our fellow citizens. First, in the form of information the DOST can provide them &mdash; science-based information. Second, technology that can offer possible solutions to the problems they may face in the future. And of course, the training or skills that we need to provide them.)</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">Albert A. Mogul, Regional Director of the Office of Civil Defense&ndash;CAR (OCD-CAR), highlighted the remarkable progress in disaster risk reduction in the region. He noted that in the wake of Typhoon Ompong in 2018, which tragically claimed 116 lives, the number of casualties from subsequent weather disturbances, including the Habagat and several typhoons, has significantly dropped to as few as five. This dramatic decrease underscored the effectiveness of science-based strategies, strengthened local capacities, and early warning systems in mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. The message is clear: science-based planning saves lives.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">Central to this transformation is the DOST&rsquo;s GeoRiskPH platform&mdash;a suite of geospatial tools enabling early warnings, hazard mapping, and risk-informed decision-making.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Empowering local minds, capacitation of our people&mdash;because hindi lang sila recipient ng ayuda or di kaya ay pakiki-pagtilulungan sa kanila, imbes posible ang solusyon ay manggaling sa kanila</em>,&rdquo; underscores Sec. Solidum.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">DILG-CAR Regional Director Anthony C. Nuyda emphasized the importance of local government units (LGUs) adopting evidence-based tools and innovations. He noted that without using the technologies developed by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), LGUs will not be fully prepared to tackle the challenges they encounter &mdash; particularly in disaster risk reduction. &ldquo;<em>Hindi po magiging prepared ang LGU if they are not using or even relying on all the science-based technologies na na-developed po ng DOST. So, DILG is in full support.</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">According to Sec. Solidum, around 223 LGUs and thousands of DRRM representatives have been trained on the GeoRisk platform. These efforts have empowered communities to make informed, life-saving decisions during calamities such as Typhoon Ulysses and other seismic activities.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">This shift was on full display during the HANDA Pilipinas event series, where LGUs interacted directly with technology developers, scientists, and fellow innovators. Beyond a traditional exhibit, HANDA Pilipinas is a launchpad for sustained engagement, showcasing scalable technologies, which supports the commercialization of disaster resilience tools such as the MCCOV (The Mobile Command and Control Vehicle) and localized flood sensors.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">The result? LGUs like Baguio City are transitioning into smart, sustainable communities, supported by DOST&rsquo;s modular development frameworks such as iSTART and CEST. These roadmaps provide flexible, data-informed pathways for local governments to evolve, regardless of size or geographic challenge.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">&ldquo;This HANDA Pilipinas is a game changer. <em>May concrete accomplishments. Pag-alis po ng HANDA Pilipinas, tuloy-tuloy po yung engagements with the LGUs, tuloy-tuloy po ang deployment ng technologies, and as mentioned, bumababa ang ating casualties</em>,&rdquo; said DOST Undersecretary for Regional Operations Sancho Maborrang.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">Furthermore, Sec. Solidum underscores a fundamental motivation driving communities&rsquo; involvement, not external rewards or mandates, but their own survival and safety. He emphasizes that participation in preparedness efforts is not merely encouraged; it is imperative. &ldquo;<em>The real incentive for LGUs is their own safety. It&rsquo;s a must for them to participate kasi incentive sa kanila yung preparedness nila,</em>&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">Looking ahead, the DOST aims to scale its vision of attaining smart and sustainable cities, towns, and provinces nationwide, with over 90 pilot LGUs already making significant progress. As more local leaders embrace science and technology, the country moves closer to a future where every community is not just prepared for disaster, but resilient and future-ready.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-6 leading-relaxed montserrat-regular">The DOST aims to provide science-based, innovative, and inclusive solutions across the four strategic pillars: human well-being, wealth creation, wealth protection, and sustainability. These pillars embody the mantra OneDOST4U: Solutions, Opportunities for All. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.dost.gov.ph">www.dost.gov.ph</a><strong><em>. (By Abigael S.
